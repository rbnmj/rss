The high dimensionality and non-Euclidean nature of tree space complicates summarizing the central tendency and variance of the posterior distribution in tree space. Here we introduce a new tractable tree distribution and associated point estimator that can be constructed from a posterior sample of trees. Through simulation studies we show that this point estimator performs at least as well and often better than standard methods of producing Bayesian posterior summary trees. We also show that the method of summary that performs best depends on the sample size and dimensionality of the problem in non-trivial ways.",

Baker\n\r\n\r\nThe ubiquitous Notch receptor signalling network is essential for tissue growth and maintenance. Operationally, receptor activity is regulated by two principal, counterposed mechanisms: intercellular Notch transactivation triggered by interactions between receptors and ligands expressed in neighbouring cells; intracellular cis inhibition mediated by ligands binding to receptors expressed in the same cell. Moreover, different Notch receptor/ligand combinations are known to elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses, and together, these phenomena determine the strength, the duration and the specificity of Notch receptor signalling. To date, it has been assumed that these processes involve discrete ligand homomers and not heteromeric complexes composed of more than one ligand species. In this study, we explore the molecular basis of the opposing actions of the Notch ligands, DLL4 and JAG1, which control angiogenic sprouting. Through a combination of experimental approaches and mathematical modelling, we provide evidence that two mechanisms could underpin this process: 1) DLL4 rather than JAG1 induces efficient Notch1 receptor transactivation; 2) JAG1 directly blocks DLL4-dependent cis-inhibition of Notch signalling through the formation of a JAG1/DLL4 complex. We propose a new model of Notch signalling that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells, which is necessary for sprouting angiogenesis.",

Moreover, biases in biomedical research and database annotation limit our interpretation of facts and generation of hypotheses. ENQUIRE (Expanding Networks by Querying Unexpectedly Inter-Related Entities) offers a time- and resource-efficient alternative to manual literature curation and database mining. ENQUIRE reconstructs and expands co-occurrence networks of genes and biomedical ontologies from user-selected input corpora and network-inferred PubMed queries. Its modest resource usage and the integration of text mining, automatic querying, and network-based statistics mitigating literature biases makes ENQUIRE unique in its broad-scope applications. For example, ENQUIRE can generate co-occurrence gene networks that reflect high-confidence, functional networks. When tested on case studies spanning cancer, cell differentiation and immunity, ENQUIRE identified interlinked genes and enriched pathways unique to each topic, thereby preserving their underlying context specificity. ENQUIRE supports biomedical researchers by easing literature annotation, boosting hypothesis formulation, and facilitating the identification of molecular targets for subsequent experimentation.",

          "description": "by Subhadip Biswas, Davit A Potoyan\n\r\n\r\nMany eukaryotic proteins and RNAs contain low-complexity domains (LCDs) with a strong propensity for binding and driving phase separation into biomolecular condensates. Mutations in LCDs frequently disrupt condensate dynamics, resulting in pathological transitions to solid-like states. Understanding how the molecular sequence grammar of LCDs governs condensate dynamics is essential for uncovering their biological functions and the evolutionary forces that shape these sequences. To this end, we present an energy landscape framework that operates on a continuous ‘stickiness’ energy scale rather than relying on an explicit alphabet-based sequence. Sequences are characterized by Wasserstein distance relative to thoroughly shuffled or random counterparts. Armed with an energy landscape framework, map diagrams of material and dynamical properties governed by key energy landscape features modulated by the degree of complexity in LCD arrangements, including the periodicity and local disorder in LCDs. Highly periodic LCD patterns promote elasticity-dominated behavior, while random sequences exhibit viscosity-dominated properties. Our results reveal that minimum sticker periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condensates, thereby avoiding transitions to glassy or solid-like states. Moreover, we demonstrate that the energy landscape framework explains the recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts systematic alterations in condensate viscoelasticity. Our work provides a unifying perspective on the sequence-encoded material properties whereby key features of energy landscapes are conserved while sequences are variable.",

It also involves readiness to stop or switch actions in response to environmental changes. Although considerable research has been devoted to understanding how the brain switches actions, the computations underlying the switching process and how it relates to the selecting and stopping processes remain elusive. A normative theory suggests that switching is simply an extension of the stopping process, during which a current action is first inhibited by an independent pause mechanism before a new action is generated.

          "description": "by Yanru Jiang, Rick Dale\n\r\n\r\nThere is an important challenge in systematically interpreting the internal representations of deep neural networks (DNNs). Existing techniques are often less effective for non-tabular tasks, or they primarily focus on qualitative, ad-hoc interpretations of models. In response, this study introduces a cognitive science-inspired, multi-dimensional quantification and visualization approach that captures two temporal dimensions of model learning: the “information-processing trajectory” and the “developmental trajectory.” The former represents the influence of incoming signals on an agent’s decision-making, while the latter conceptualizes the gradual improvement in an agent’s performance throughout its lifespan. Tracking the learning curves of DNNs enables researchers to explicitly identify the model appropriateness of a given task, examine the properties of the underlying input signals, and assess the model’s alignment (or lack thereof) with human learning experiences. To illustrate this method, we conducted 750 runs of simulations on two temporal tasks: gesture detection and sentence classification, showcasing its applicability across different types of deep learning tasks. Using four descriptive metrics to quantify the mapped learning curves—start, end - start, max, tmax—, we identified significant differences in learning patterns based on data sources and class distinctions (all p’s  non-monotonic progress, pairwise comparisons, and domain distinctions. We reflect on the theoretical implications of this method for cognitive processing, language models and representations from multiple modalities.",

However, traditional dimensionality reduction techniques cannot accomplish this because they operate on only one dataset. Contrastive principal component analysis (cPCA) has been proposed to address this problem, but it has seen little adoption because it requires tuning a hyperparameter resulting in multiple solutions, with no way of knowing which is correct. Moreover, cPCA uses foreground and background conditions that are treated differently, making it ill-suited to compare two experimental conditions symmetrically. Here we describe the development of generalized contrastive PCA (gcPCA), a flexible hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems. We first provide analyses explaining why cPCA requires a hyperparameter and how gcPCA avoids this requirement. We then describe an open-source gcPCA toolbox containing Python and MATLAB implementations of several variants of gcPCA tailored for different scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data. As a fast, robust, and easy-to-use comparison method, gcPCA provides a valuable resource facilitating the analysis of diverse high-dimensional datasets to gain new insights into complex biological phenomena.",

Santacruz\n\r\n\r\nLarge-scale recordings of neural activity over broad anatomical areas with high spatial and temporal resolution are increasingly common in modern experimental neuroscience. Recently, recurrent switching dynamical systems have been used to tackle the scale and complexity of these data. However, an important challenge remains in providing insights into the existence and structure of recurrent linear dynamics in neural time series data. Here we test a scalable approach to time-varying autoregression with low-rank tensors to recover the recurrent dynamics in stochastic neural mass models with multiple stable attractors. We demonstrate that the parsimonious representation of time-varying system matrices in terms of temporal modes can recover the attractor structure of simple systems via clustering. We then consider simulations based on a human brain connectivity matrix in high and low global connection strength regimes, and reveal the hierarchical clustering structure of the dynamics. Finally, we explain the impact of the forecast time delay on the estimation of the underlying rank and temporal variability of the time series dynamics. This study illustrates that prediction error minimization is not sufficient to recover meaningful dynamic structure and that it is crucial to account for the three key timescales arising from dynamics, noise processes, and attractor switching.",

Epigenetic clocks are often trained on DNAm using penalized regression of CpG sites, but recent evidence suggests potential benefits of training epigenetic predictors on principal components.\n Methodology/findings \nWe developed a pipeline to simultaneously train three epigenetic predictors; a traditional CpG Clock, a PCA Clock, and a SuperLearner PCA Clock (SL PCA). We gathered publicly available DNAm datasets to generate i) a novel childhood epigenetic clock, ii) a reconstructed Hannum adult blood clock, and iii) as a proof of concept, a predictor of polybrominated biphenyl exposure using the three developmental methodologies. We used correlation coefficients and median absolute error to assess fit between predicted and observed measures, as well as agreement between duplicates. The SL PCA clocks improved fit with observed phenotypes relative to the PCA clocks or CpG clocks across several datasets. We found evidence for higher agreement between duplicate samples run on alternate DNAm arrays when using SL PCA clocks relative to traditional methods. Analyses examining associations between relevant exposures and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) produced more precise effect estimates when using predictions derived from SL PCA clocks.\n Conclusions \nWe introduce a novel method for the development of DNAm-based predictors that combines the improved reliability conferred by training on principal components with advanced ensemble-based machine learning. Coupling SuperLearner with PCA in the predictor development process may be especially relevant for studies with longitudinal designs utilizing multiple array types, as well as for the development of predictors of more complex phenotypic traits.",

Antigenic evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has shown that much of the spontaneous antibody response is narrowly focused rather than broadly neutralizing against even SARS-CoV-2 variants, let alone future threats. One way to overcome this is by focusing the antibody response against better-conserved regions of the viral spike protein. This has been demonstrated empirically in prior work, but we posit that systematic design tools will further potentiate antigenic focusing approaches. Here, we present a design approach to predict stable chimeras between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, creating synthetic spike proteins that display a desired conserved region, in this case S2, and vary other regions. We leverage AlphaFold to predict chimeric structures and create a new metric for scoring chimera stability based on AlphaFold outputs. We evaluated 114 candidate spike chimeras using this approach. Top chimeras were further evaluated using molecular dynamics simulation as an intermediate validation technique, showing good stability compared to low-scoring controls. Experimental testing of five predicted-stable and two predicted-unstable chimeras confirmed 5/7 predictions, with one intermediate result. This demonstrates the feasibility of the underlying approach, which can be used to design custom immunogens to focus the immune response against a desired viral glycoprotein epitope.",

Kelley, Geoffrey Fudenberg\n\r\n\r\nInterphase mammalian genomes are folded in 3D with complex locus-specific patterns that impact gene regulation. CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is a key architectural protein that binds specific DNA sites, halts cohesin-mediated loop extrusion, and enables long-range chromatin interactions. There are hundreds of thousands of annotated CTCF-binding sites in mammalian genomes; disruptions of some result in distinct phenotypes, while others have no visible effect. Despite their importance, the determinants of which CTCF sites are necessary for genome folding and gene regulation remain unclear. Here, we update and utilize Akita, a convolutional neural network model, to extract the sequence preferences and grammar of CTCF contributing to genome folding. Our analyses of individual CTCF sites reveal four predictions: (i) only a small fraction of genomic sites are impactful; (ii) impact is highly dependent on sequences flanking the core CTCF binding motif; (iii) core and flanking nucleotides contribute largely additively to the overall impact of a site; (iv) sites created as combinations of different core and flanking sequences have impacts proportional to the product of their average impacts, i.e. they are broadly compatible. Our analysis of collections of CTCF sites make two predictions for multi-motif grammar: (i) insulation strength depends on the number of CTCF sites within a cluster, and (ii) pattern formation is governed by the orientation and spacing of these sites, rather than any inherent specialization of the CTCF motifs themselves. In sum, we present a framework for using neural network models to probe the sequences instructing genome folding and provide a number of predictions to guide future experimental inquiries.",

The standard way to study repeated games is to assume that there is an exogenous probability with which every interaction is repeated. If it is sufficiently likely that interactions are repeated, then reciprocity and cooperation can evolve together in repeated prisoner’s dilemmas. Who individuals interact with can however also be under their control, or at least to some degree. If we change the standard model so that it allows for individuals to terminate the interaction with their current partner, and find someone else to play their prisoner’s dilemmas with, then this limits the effectiveness of disciplining each other within the partnership, as one can always leave to escape punishment. The option to leave can however also be used to get away from someone who is not cooperating, which also has a disciplining effect. We find that the net effect of introducing the option to leave on cooperation is positive; with the option to leave, the average amount of cooperation that evolves in simulations is substantially higher than without. One of the reasons for this increase in cooperation is that partner choice creates endogenous phenotypic assortment. Compared to the standard models for the co-evolution of reciprocity and cooperation, and models of kin selection, our model thereby produces a better match with many forms of human cooperation in repeated settings. Individuals in our model end up interacting, not with random others that they cannot separate from, once matched, or with others that they are genetically related to, but with partners that they choose to stay with, and that are similarly dependable not to play defect as they are themselves.",

Past studies suggest that neuronal spiking produces broadband signals and shapes the spectral trend of invasive macroscopic recordings, but it is unclear to what extent action potentials (APs) influence scalp EEG. Here, we combined biophysical simulations with statistical modelling to examine the amplitude and spectral content of scalp potentials generated by the electric fields from spiking activity. In physiological parameter regimes, we found that APs contribute negligibly to the EEG spectral trend. Consistent with this, comparing our biophysical simulations with previously published data from pharmacologically paralyzed subjects suggested that the EEG spectral trend can be explained by a combination of synaptic timescales and electromyogram contamination. We also modelled rhythmic EEG generation, finding that APs can generate detectable narrowband power between approximately 60 and 1000 Hz, reaching frequencies much faster than would be possible from synaptic currents. Finally, we show that different spectral detrending strategies are required for AP generated oscillations compared to synaptically generated oscillations, suggesting that existing detrending methods for EEG spectra need to be modified for high frequency signals.",

However, bacteria can evolve resistance to phage, presenting a significant challenge to the near- and long-term success of phage therapeutics. Application of mixtures of multiple phages (i.e., ‘cocktails’) has been proposed to limit the emergence of phage-resistant bacterial mutants that could lead to therapeutic failure. Here, we combine theory and computational models of in vivo phage therapy to study the efficacy of a phage cocktail, composed of two complementary phages motivated by the example of Pseudomonas aeruginosa facing two phages that exploit different surface receptors, LUZ19v and PAK_P1. As confirmed in a Luria-Delbr�ck fluctuation test, this motivating example serves as a model for instances where bacteria are extremely unlikely to develop simultaneous resistance mutations against both phages. We then quantify therapeutic outcomes given single- or double-phage treatment models, as a function of phage traits and host immune strength. Building upon prior work showing monophage therapy efficacy in immunocompetent hosts, here we show that phage cocktails comprised of phage targeting independent bacterial receptors can improve treatment outcome in immunocompromised hosts and reduce the chance that pathogens simultaneously evolve resistance against phage combinations. The finding of phage cocktail efficacy is qualitatively robust to differences in virus-bacteria interactions and host immune dynamics. Altogether, the combined use of theory and computational analysis highlights the influence of viral life history traits and receptor complementarity when designing and deploying phage cocktails in immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts.",

However, gauging the public health utility for future use of such transmissible vaccines and assessing their risk-benefit tradeoff, given their potential for unintended evolution, hinges on accurate estimates of their indirect protective effect. Here, we establish the conditions under which a two-stage randomized field trial can characterize the protective effects of a transmissible vaccine relative to a traditional vaccine. We contrast the sample sizes required to adequately power these trials when the vaccine is weakly and strongly transmissible. We also identify how required sample sizes change based on the characteristics of host ecology such as the overdispersion of the contact structure of the population, as well as the efficacy of the vaccine and timing of vaccination. Our results indicate the range of scenarios where two-stage randomized field trial designs are feasible and appropriate to capture the protective effects of transmissible vaccines. Our estimates identify the protective benefit of using transmissible vaccines compared to traditional vaccines, and thus can be used to weigh against evolutionary risks.",

We introduce new serocatalytic models of successive outbreaks and extend existing models of seroreversion to any transmission model. The different features of the package are illustrated with simulated and real-life data.

To access longer timescales of behavior, we continuously recorded individual Drosophila melanogaster at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days at a time in featureless arenas on sucrose-agarose media. We use the deep learning framework SLEAP to produce a full-body postural dataset for 47 individuals resulting in nearly 2 billion pose instances. We identify stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion and use the resulting ethograms to explore how the flies’ behavior varies across time of day and days in the experiment. We find distinct daily patterns in all stereotyped behaviors, adding specific information about trends in different grooming modalities, proboscis extension duration, and locomotion speed to what is known about the D. melanogaster circadian cycle. Using our holistic measurements of behavior, we find that the hour after dawn is a unique time point in the flies’ daily pattern of behavior, and that the behavioral composition of this hour tracks well with other indicators of health such as locomotion speed and the fraction of time spend moving vs. resting. The method, data, and analysis presented here give us a new and clearer picture of D. melanogaster behavior across timescales, revealing novel features that hint at unexplored underlying biological mechanisms.",

Neuwald, Jianhua Xuan\n\r\n\r\nWe develop a Bayesian approach, BayesIso, to identify differentially expressed isoforms from RNA-seq data. The approach features a novel joint model of the sample variability and the deferential state of isoforms. Specifically, the within-sample variability and the between-sample variability of each isoform are modeled by a Poisson-Lognormal model and a Gamma-Gamma model, respectively. Using a Bayesian framework, the differential state of each isoform and the model parameters are jointly estimated by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Extensive studies using simulation and real data demonstrate that BayesIso can effectively detect isoforms of less differentially expressed and differential transcripts for genes with multiple isoforms. We applied the approach to breast cancer RNA-seq data and uncovered a unique set of isoforms that form key pathways associated with breast cancer recurrence. First, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and PTEN signaling pathways are identified as being involved in breast cancer development. Further integrated with protein-protein interaction data, pathways of Jak-STAT, mTOR, MAPK and Wnt signaling are revealed in association with breast cancer recurrence. Finally, several pathways are activated in the early recurrence of breast cancer. In tumors that occur early, members of pathways of cellular metabolism and cell cycle (such as CD36 and TOP2A) are upregulated, while immune response genes such as NFATC1 are downregulated.",

Considering the genomic differences among cancer patients, determining the most effective drug treatment plan is a complex and crucial task. In response to these challenges, this study introduces the Adaptive Sparse Graph Contrastive Learning Network (ASGCL), an innovative approach to unraveling latent interactions in the complex context of cancer cell lines and drugs. The core of ASGCL is the GraphMorpher module, an innovative component that enhances the input graph structure via strategic node attribute masking and topological pruning. By contrasting the augmented graph with the original input, the model delineates distinct positive and negative sample sets at both node and graph levels. This dual-level contrastive approach significantly amplifies the model’s discriminatory prowess in identifying nuanced drug responses. Leveraging a synergistic combination of supervised and contrastive loss, ASGCL accomplishes end-to-end learning of feature representations, substantially outperforming existing methodologies. Comprehensive ablation studies underscore the efficacy of each component, corroborating the model’s robustness. Experimental evaluations further illuminate ASGCL’s proficiency in predicting drug responses, offering a potent tool for guiding clinical decision-making in cancer therapy.",

By analyzing real data and a simple model, we show that neural oscillations play a key role in the appearance of this toroidal topology. To quantitatively monitor how changes in spike trains influence the topology of the data, we first define a robust measure for the degree of toroidality of a dataset. Using this measure, we find that small perturbations ( ~ 100 ms) of spike times have little influence on both the toroidality and the hexagonality of the ratemaps. Jittering spikes by  ~ 100-500 ms, however, destroys the toroidal topology, while still having little impact on grid scores. These critical jittering time scales fall in the range of the periods of oscillations between the theta and eta bands. We thus hypothesized that these oscillatory modulations of neuronal spiking play a key role in the appearance and robustness of toroidal topology and the hexagonal spatial selectivity is not sufficient. We confirmed this hypothesis using a simple model for the activity of grid cells, consisting of an ensemble of independent rate-modulated Poisson processes. When these rates were modulated by oscillations, the network behaved similarly to the real data in exhibiting toroidal topology, even when the position of the fields were perturbed. In the absence of oscillations, this similarity was substantially lower. Furthermore, we find that the experimentally recorded spike trains indeed exhibit temporal modulations at the eta and theta bands, and that the ratio of the power in the eta band to that of the theta band, Aη∕Aθ, correlates with the critical jittering time at which the toroidal topology disappears.",

It is not always clear, however, how these theoretically-derived rules relate to biological mechanisms of plasticity in the brain, or how these different rules might be mechanistically implemented in different contexts and brain regions. This study shows that the calcium control hypothesis, which relates synaptic plasticity in the brain to the calcium concentration ([Ca2+]) in dendritic spines, can produce a diverse array of learning rules. We propose a simple, perceptron-like neuron model that has four sources of [Ca2+]: local (following the activation of an excitatory synapse and confined to that synapse), heterosynaptic (resulting from the activity of other synapses), postsynaptic spike-dependent, and supervisor-dependent. We demonstrate that by modulating the plasticity thresholds and calcium influx from each calcium source, we can reproduce a wide range of learning and plasticity protocols, such as Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning, frequency-dependent plasticity, and unsupervised recognition of frequently repeating input patterns. Moreover, by devising simple neural circuits to provide supervisory signals, we show how the calcitron can implement homeostatic plasticity, perceptron learning, and BTSP-inspired one-shot learning. Our study bridges the gap between theoretical learning algorithms and their biological counterparts, not only replicating established learning paradigms but also introducing novel rules.",

The nature wrapping of DNA around histone core form a 1.7 left-handed superhelical turns, contributing to negative supercoiling in chromatin. During transcription, negative supercoils generated behind the polymerase during transcription may play a role in triggering nucleosome reassembly. To elucidate how supercoils influence the dynamics of wrapping of DNA around the histone cores, we developed a novel model to simulate the intricate interplay between DNA and histone. Our simulations reveal that both positively and negatively supercoiled DNAs are capable of wrapping around histone cores to adopt the nucleosome conformation. Notably, our findings confirm a strong preference for negative supercoiled DNA during nucleosome wrapping, and reveal that the both of the negative writhe and twist are beneficial to the formation of the DNA wrapping around histone. Additionally, the simulations of the multiple nucleosomes on the same DNA template indicate that the nucleosome tends to assemble in proximity to the original nucleosome. This advancement in understanding the spontaneous formation of nucleosomes may offer insights into the complex dynamics of chromatin assembly and the fundamental mechanisms governing the structure and function of chromatin.",

Alexandrov, Dvira Segal, Anton Zilman\n\r\n\r\nEfflux pumps that transport antibacterial drugs out of bacterial cells have broad specificity, commonly leading to broad spectrum resistance and limiting treatment strategies for infections. It remains unclear how efflux pumps can maintain this broad spectrum specificity to diverse drug molecules while limiting the efflux of other cytoplasmic content. We have investigated the origins of this broad specificity using theoretical models informed by the experimentally determined structural and kinetic properties of efflux pumps. We developed a set of mathematical models describing operation of efflux pumps as a discrete cyclic stochastic process across a network of states characterizing pump conformations and the presence/absence of bound ligands and protons. These include a minimal three-state model that lends itself to clear analytic calculations as well as a five-state model that relaxes some of the simpler model’s most strict assumptions. We found that the pump specificity is determined not solely by the drug affinity to the pump–as is commonly assumed–but it is also directly affected by the periplasmic pH and the transmembrane potential. Therefore, changes to the proton concentration gradient and voltage drop across the membrane can influence how effective the pump is at extruding a particular drug molecule. Furthermore, we found that while both the proton concentration gradient across the membrane and the transmembrane potential contribute to the thermodynamic force driving the pump, their effects on the efflux enter not strictly in a combined proton motive force. Rather, they have two distinguishable effects on the overall throughput. These results highlight the unexpected effects of thermodynamic driving forces out of equilibrium and illustrate how efflux pump structure and function are conducive to the emergence of multidrug resistance.",

Despite extensive research, it remains unclear why the visual system employs such broadly tuned face detection capabilities. We hypothesized that face pareidolia results from the visual system’s optimization for recognizing both faces and objects. To test this hypothesis, we used task-optimized deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and evaluated their alignment with human behavioral signatures and neural responses, measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG), related to pareidolia processing. Specifically, we trained CNNs on tasks involving combinations of face identification, face detection, object categorization, and object detection. Using representational similarity analysis, we found that CNNs that included object categorization in their training tasks represented pareidolia faces, real faces, and matched objects more similarly to neural responses than those that did not. Although these CNNs showed similar overall alignment with neural data, a closer examination of their internal representations revealed that specific training tasks had distinct effects on how pareidolia faces were represented across layers. Finally, interpretability methods revealed that only a CNN trained for both face identification and object categorization relied on face-like features—such as ‘eyes’—to classify pareidolia stimuli as faces, mirroring findings in human perception. Our results suggest that human-like face pareidolia may emerge from the visual system’s optimization for face identification within the context of generalized object categorization.",

We study Kolmogorov forward equations (KFEs) and Zakai equations for diffusion processes with a fast mean-reverting stochastic volatility component. In the case of the KFE, a parabolic PDE in divergence form, we perform a matched asymptotic expansion up to first order in the small mean-reversion time. The solutions are expressed in terms of suitable PDEs with coefficients averaged over the ergodic distribution, in the spirit of extensive earlier work on the backward equation (see [J.-P. Fouque et al., Multiscale Stochastic Volatility for Equity, Interest Rate, and Credit Derivatives, Cambridge, University Press, 2011]). We then construct a sequence of approximations to the Zakai equation, a parabolic stochastic PDE (SPDE), and verify numerically for the first two terms weak convergence order half and order one, respectively, in the mean-reversion parameter. To this end, we give a novel numerical scheme for the original two-dimensional SPDE, which is robust in the small parameter regime, and compare derived functionals of marginals against those approximated by the solution of a sequence of homogenized one-dimensional SPDEs.",

In this paper, we investigate an effective model for reactive transport in elastically deformable perforated media. This model was derived by formal asymptotic expansions in [J. Knoch, M. Gahn, M. Neuss-Radu, and N. Neuß, Transp. Porous Media, 147 (2023), pp. 93–123], starting from a microscopic model consisting of a linear elasticity problem on a fixed domain, i.e., in the Lagrangian framework, and a problem for reactive transport on the current deformed domain, i.e., in the Eulerian framework. The effective model is of micro-macro type and features strong nonlinear couplings. Here, we prove global existence in time and uniqueness for the effective micro-macro model under a smallness assumption for the data of the macroscopic elasticity subproblem. Moreover, we show numerically the convergence of microscopic solutions towards the solution of the effective model when the scale parameter [math] becomes smaller and smaller, and also compute the approximation error. The numerical justification of the formally derived effective micro-macro model is particularly important, as rigorous analytical convergence proofs or error estimates are not available so far. Finally, we compare the effective micro-macro model with alternative, simpler effective descriptions of transport in elastic perforated media.",

          "description": "Multiscale Modeling & Simulation, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 431-457, March 2025. \n Abstract. We propose a novel efficient and robust wavelet-based edge multiscale finite element method (WEMsFEM) motivated by [S. Fu, E. Chung, and G. Li, J. Comput. Phys., 396 (2019), pp. 228–242], [G. Li, Multiscale Model. Simul., 17 (2019), pp. 593–619] to solve the singularly perturbed convection-diffusion equations. The main idea is to first establish a local splitting of the solution over a local region by a local bubble part and local harmonic extension part, and then derive a global splitting by means of partition of unity. This facilitates a representation of the solution as a summation of a global bubble part and a global harmonic extension part, where the first part can be computed locally in parallel. To approximate the second part, we construct an edge multiscale ansatz space locally with hierarchical bases as the local boundary data that has a guaranteed approximation rate both inside and outside of the layers. The key innovation of this proposed WEMsFEM lies in a provable convergence rate with little restriction on the mesh size. Its convergence rate with respect to the computational degree of freedom is rigorously analyzed, which is verified by extensive 2-d and 3-d numerical tests.",

We study the behavior of shallow water waves over periodically varying bathymetry, based on the first-order hyperbolic Saint-Venant equations. Although solutions of this system are known to generally exhibit wave breaking, numerical experiments suggest a different behavior in the presence of periodic bathymetry. Starting from the first-order variable-coefficient hyperbolic system, we apply a multiple-scale perturbation approach in order to derive a system of constant-coefficient high-order partial differential equations whose solution approximates that of the original system. The high-order system turns out to be dispersive and exhibits solitary-wave formation, in close agreement with direct numerical simulations of the original system. We show that the constant-coefficient homogenized system can be used to study the properties of solitary waves and to conduct efficient numerical simulations.",

This paper considers minimizers of the Ginzburg–Landau energy functional in specific multiscale spaces that are based on finite elements. The spaces are constructed by localized orthogonal decomposition techniques and their usage for solving the Ginzburg–Landau equation was first suggested in [B. Dörich and P. Henning, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 62 (2024), pp. 1313–1343]. In this work we further explore their approximation properties and give an analytical explanation for why vortex structures of energy minimizers can be captured more accurately in these spaces. We quantify the necessary mesh resolution in terms of the Ginzburg–Landau parameter [math] and a stabilization parameter [math] that is used in the construction of the multiscale spaces. Furthermore, we analyze how [math] affects the necessary locality of the multiscale basis functions and we prove that the choice [math] yields typically the highest accuracy. Our findings are supported by numerical experiments.",

This paper proposes a novel collocation-type numerical stochastic homogenization method for prototypical stochastic homogenization problems with random coefficient fields of small correlation lengths. The presented method is based on a recently introduced localization technique that enforces a super-exponential decay of the basis functions relative to the underlying coarse mesh, resulting in considerable computational savings during the sampling phase. More generally, the collocation-type structure offers a particularly simple and computationally efficient construction in the stochastic setting with minimized communication between the patches where the basis functions of the method are computed. An error analysis that bridges numerical homogenization and the quantitative theory of stochastic homogenization is performed. In a series of numerical experiments, we study the effect of the correlation length and the discretization parameters on the approximation quality of the method.",

In this paper, we numerically solve the long-time nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) by using an oscillation-relaxation formulation. Such a formulation allows us to propose a class of numerical methods named oscillation-relaxation integrators (ORIs) for NLSE. By convergence analysis, the [math]th order ORIs (for any [math]) are shown to offer error bounds of form [math] up to time interval [math] with [math] the time stepsize. Compared with the splitting schemes that give error bounds [math], the accuracy of ORIs are significantly improved. Numerical experiments and comparisons confirm the gain in practical efficiency. Long-term near-conservation laws of symmetric ORIs are also established and tested. Numerical exploration on longer time intervals show that ORIs can produce accurate results till times [math], thanks to the improved error constants.",

The thermal radiative transfer equations model temperature evolution through a background medium as a result of radiation. On a long time scale, the dynamics tend to a nonlinear diffusion-type equation called the Rosseland approximation. The main challenges for constructing numerical schemes that exhibit the correct limiting behavior are posed by the solution’s high-dimensional phase space and multiscale effects. In this work, we propose an asymptotic-preserving and rank-adaptive dynamical low-rank approximation scheme based on the macro-micro decomposition of the particle density and a modified augmented basis-update and Galerkin integrator. We show that this scheme, for linear particle emission by the material, dissipates energy over time under a step size restriction that captures the hyperbolic and parabolic CFL conditions. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in a series of numerical experiments.",

Known as the no fast-forwarding theorem in quantum computing (see, e.g., Theorem 3 in [D. W. Berry et al., Comm. Math. Phys., 270 (2007), pp. 359–371], Theorem 5 in [A. M. Childs, Comm. Math. Phys., 294 (2010), pp. 581–603], and [R. Kothari, Efficient Simulation of Hamiltonians, M.S. thesis, University of Waterloo, 2010]), the simulation time for the Hamiltonian evolution is typically [math], which essentially states that one cannot go across the multiple scales as the simulation time for the Hamiltonian evolution needs to be strictly greater than the physical time. We demonstrated in the context of the semiclassical Schrödinger equation that the computational cost for a class of observables can be much lower than the state-of-the-art bounds. In the semiclassical regime (the effective Planck constant [math]), the operator norm of the Hamiltonian is [math]. We show that the number of Trotter steps used for the observable evolution can be [math], that is, to simulate some observables of the Schrödinger equation on a quantum scale only takes the simulation time comparable to the classical scale. In terms of error analysis, we improve the additive observable error bounds in [C. Lasser and C. Lubich, Acta Numer., 29 (2020), pp. 229–401] to uniform-in-[math] observable error bounds. This is, to our knowledge, the first uniform observable error bound for the semiclassical Schrödinger equation without sacrificing the convergence order of the numerical method. Based on semiclassical calculus and discrete microlocal analysis, our result showcases the potential improvements taking advantage of multiscale properties, such as the smallness of the effective Planck constant, and of the underlying dynamics, and sheds light on going across the scale for quantum dynamics simulation.",

It is widely admitted in the heat transfer community that a steady laminar flow in a periodic channel becomes periodically developed after a small distance from the channel inlet. In this article, we provide a mathematical proof of this result for steady incompressible Stokes flows. Assuming the strip is a juxtaposition of [math] periodic unit cells with a prescribed velocity at the inlet and a zero normal-stress boundary condition at the outlet, we prove that the velocity and pressure fields can be approximated up to exponentially small errors as [math] by the sum of two terms: (i) a periodic velocity field driven by a constant pressure gradient propagating the input mass flow through the channel, …",
